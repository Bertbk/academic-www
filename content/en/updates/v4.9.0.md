## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.9 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- More **intuitive** approach for users to **choose a light, dark, or automatic (system default) appearance**
- Now also **edit talks, publications, and projects online in the admin panel**
- **Screen reader** support added for featured images
- Initial support for **Right to Left (RTL) languages**

{{< figure library="1" src="docs/appearance-chooser.png" title="Version 4.9 makes choosing a site appearance even more intuitive with textual labels rather than icons for the _light_, _dark_, and _auto (system default)_ modes." >}}

## More intuitive appearance selector

Rather than a 3-way icon-based toggle through light, dark, and automatic modes, present the user with a dropdown list of modes displayed in full textual representation. See #1596.

Adds language pack options for translating _Light_ (`theme_light`), _Dark_ (`theme_dark`), and _Automatic_ (`theme_auto`).

## Screen reading featured images

An optional `alt_text` parameter can be added when specifying a featured `image` in a page's front matter. Alt text is used to describe the image when the page is read aloud by a screen reader. See #1592.

Additionally, the profile photo alt text has been improved from "avatar" to the person's name, in alignment with major CMS and social sites.

## Breaking changes

- Rename `name` to `title` in author profiles within `author/` folder.
- Make taxonomy URLs singular, consistent with other Academic pages by adding the following to your [config/_default/config.toml](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/601620c7a66212e2da873b2e3780a8051b60b79e#diff-8d0f7bcc0d4bed4832625ea6b50478e1) file:
   ```toml
   # Workaround Hugo publishing taxonomy URLs as plurals - consistently use singular across Academic.
   [permalinks]
     authors = "/author/:slug/"
     tags = "/tag/:slug/"
     categories = "/category/:slug/"
     publication_types = "/publication-type/:slug/"
   ```
- For non-English sites, add language pack options for translating _Light_ (`theme_light`), _Dark_ (`theme_dark`), and _Automatic_ (`theme_auto`). Refer to the docs on customising the interface language for more info.
- Add support for **editing talks, publications, and projects in Netlify CMS** in addition to **fixing `TypeError: e.replace is not a function` error** when using _Netlify CMS_ (#1593)
  - Update your `static/admin/config.yml` file from https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/exampleSite/static/admin/config.yml
